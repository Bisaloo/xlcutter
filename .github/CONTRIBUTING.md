# Contributing to xlcutter

There are many ways you can contribute to xlcutter. All contributions are very 
much welcome and only some of them require technical knowledge. If you have 
something you would like to contribute, but you are not sure how, please don't
hesitate to reach out by opening an 
[issue](https://github.com/Bisaloo/xlcutter/issues) or sending me an email.

## üó£Ô∏è Spreading the word

The easiest (and possibly one of the most useful) way you can contribute to 
xlcutter is by spreading the word. Please 
[cite it](https://hugogruson.fr/xlcutter/authors.html) in your 
publications and tell your friends and colleagues about it!

## ‚úçÔ∏è Fixing typos

Small typos or grammatical errors in documentation may be edited directly using
the GitHub web interface, so long as the changes are made in the _source_ file.
In other words, please edit a `.R` file in the `R/` folder, and not the `.Rd`
files in the `man/` folder. This is because this package uses 
[roxygen2](https://roxygen2.r-lib.org/) to automatically rebuild the `.Rd`
files.

## üìÑ Contributing use cases

I am very excited to hear about it if you find this package helpful, and in
which context you use it.
Knowing about a package is used helps informing future development.
If you are using this package, please start a thread about it [in the dedicated
"Discussions" section](https://github.com/Bisaloo/xlcutter/discussions/categories/show-and-tell).

## üò• Reporting bugs

If you think you found a bug in xlcutter, even if you're unsure, please let me 
know. The best way is to open an issue on GitHub: 
https://github.com/ropensci/Bisaloo/xlcutter

Please try to create a [reprex](https://reprex.tidyverse.org/) with the minimal
amount of code required to reproduce the bug you encountered.

Please also include your session info (e.g. via the R command 
`sessioninfo::session_info()`).

Finally, if your issue relates to the parsing of a specific file, remember to
include said file.

## üó≥Ô∏è Voting for new features

Whenever I can, I open a new issue with the upcoming plans for xlcutter. If you 
are particularly interested in a specific feature and you would like to help
me prioritise my work, please use 
[the GitHub reactions feature](https://github.blog/2016-03-10-add-reactions-to-pull-requests-issues-and-comments/).
